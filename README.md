# Project Overview 
This is a C-based Unix shell implementation developed throughout the Winter 2025 semester. 
This project involves building a fully functional shell called mysh that provides a comprehensive range of functionality matching that of other built-in shells.
The shell supports built-in commands, environment variables, file system operations, process management, pipes, and network communication.

# Core Features
- Input validation : Command is limited to 128-characters.
- User interface : Interactive prompt ( $mysh )
- Signal Handling
- Error Management 

# Installation & Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/junyalex/Linux-Shell.git # clone repository
cd src # change directory to where it has a "Makefile".
make # creates executable file.
./mysh # runs the application. 
```
